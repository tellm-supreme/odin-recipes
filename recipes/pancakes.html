    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
